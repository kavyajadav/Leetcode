Notes for reference:

Hash function in Javascript is any function that takes input as arbitrary size data and produces output as fixed-size data

The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. 

The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array

The toString() method returns a string as a string. The toString() method does not change the original string. 
The toString() method can be used to convert a string object into a string. 

The split() method splits a string into an array of substrings. The split() method returns the new array. 
The split() method does not change the original string. If (" ") is used as separator, the string is split between words.

map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. map() calls a function once for each element in an array.
map() does not execute the function for empty elements.

The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return 
value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.
